  	This website asks you where you live and then suggests the World Cup games you should watch based on who lives in your neighborhood, and where they are from.

    The World Cup brings people from different cultures together like no other global event.  The US isn't a nation of soccer fans, but it is a nation of immigrants from around the globe.  So use this website to pick a game, find a pub, and make some new friends!
