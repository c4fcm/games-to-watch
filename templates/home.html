  <h2>Watch with the Real Fans!</h2>
  <p>
    The World Cup brings people from different cultures together like no other global event.  The US isn't a nation of soccer fans, but it is a nation of immigrants from around the globe. This website asks you where you live, and then suggests the World Cup games you should watch based on who lives around you, and where they are from.  So pick a game, find a pub, and meet some new folks!
